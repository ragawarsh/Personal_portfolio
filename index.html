    <h3>Dynamic DDoS Mitigation Strategy for Container-Based Cloud
        Environments: Maximizing Quality of Service and Resource Allocation:</h3><br><br>
        <p>Led a research project evaluating the effectiveness of container technology and microservices in countering low-rate
            DDoS attacks in container-based cloud environments. Developed a robust mathematical model based on queueing
            theory to formalize attack scenarios and proposed a dynamic mitigation strategy optimizing resource allocation.
            Successfully validated the strategy through simulations and testbed experiments, demonstrating complete elimination of
            low-rate DDoS impact on whitelist requests with minimal resource utilization and enhanced system resilience against
            DDoS attacks.</p>
